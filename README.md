# Green-Pastures

This is my personal programming portfolio involving numerous projects I have worked on. My other 3 repo's are locked as they contain code written during my time at Iowa State University.

Please do not copy code from here for any homework assignments. Follow your honor code, and remember- copying does not help you learn how to program.
